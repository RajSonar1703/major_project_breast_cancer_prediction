This project is a Machine Learning-based Breast Cancer Detection System built using XGBoost (XGBClassifier).
The model uses the Breast Cancer dataset directly accessed from Scikit-learn (sklearn).

The Flask framework is used to connect the Python backend with the frontend interface, allowing users to input data and get real-time predictions about the likelihood of breast cancer.

With hyperparameter tuning and proper data preprocessing, the model achieved an accuracy of around 95–97%, making it highly reliable for prediction purposes.
